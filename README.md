# 🛡️ PrivGuard AI

**Open-Source Deidentification for Visual & Textual Data**

---

## 📌 Overview

PrivGuard AI is an open-source, privacy-first deidentification platform that enables organizations to securely process sensitive documents and images.

By combining AI-powered OCR, layout-aware analysis, and entity recognition, PrivGuard AI automatically detects, redacts, or anonymizes personally identifiable information (PII) from both structured text and semi-structured visual elements (signatures, photos, stamps).

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔒 **End-to-End Privacy by Design** → Secure document processing with anonymization baked into every stage.
* 🤖 **AI-Powered PII Detection** → OCR + NLP to identify names, addresses, IDs, and other sensitive data.
* 🖼️ **Visual Deidentification** → Detects and redacts faces, signatures, logos, and official seals.
* 📑 **Layout-Aware Processing** → Redacts content while preserving tables, forms, and PDF readability.
* ⚡ **Modular Pipelines** → Configurable workflows for redaction, masking, or pseudonymization.
* 🛠️ **Open-Source & Extensible** → Transparent, adaptable, and community-driven.
* 🌍 **Seamless Integration** → API-ready, deployable in healthcare, finance, governance, and enterprise workflows.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

* **Healthcare** → Anonymize patient records, prescriptions, medical forms.
* **Governance** → Redact IDs, voter records, citizen forms.
* **Fintech** → Protect KYC docs, financial statements, contracts.
* **Legal & Corporate** → Remove PII from contracts, compliance reports.
